<div class="bd">

		Carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and proteins are often found as long polymers in nature. Because of their polymeric nature and their large (sometimes huge!) size, they are classified as macromolecules, big (macro-) molecules made through the joining of smaller subunits. Lipids are not usually polymers and are smaller than the other three, so they are not considered macromolecules by some sources. However, many other sources use the term “macromolecule” more loosely, as a general name for the four types of large biological molecules. This is just a naming difference, so don’t get too hung up on it. Just remember that lipids are one of the four main types of large biological molecules, but that they don’t generally form polymers.

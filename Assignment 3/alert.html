			My life is nothing out of the ordinary. A Simple college going boy living a simple life. A typical day in my life consists of waking up at around 6 in the morning. I do have to be quick or else i will miss my bus in the morning. I do get a sleep in the bus for like an hour, so thats something going for me. Like always i reach college at 9 am. The ectures dont get over until 4:20 in the evening; so yes thats the grinding period of my day. Bus leaves around 5 and I dont waste anytime and catch up on my sleep in the bus, again! I reach home by 7 pm. After a day of hardwork i finally have a time for my self. I complete my assignments (if any) or watch gameplays, anime or simply play games on PC. This is the time i look forward to everyday and this is what motivates do everything again.
